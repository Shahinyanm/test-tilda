            Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various
            components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, "methods and rules upon which it
            is impossible to improve, have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to
            be brought back to life and applied." Front matter, or preliminaries, is the first section of a book, and is
            usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages. Each page is counted, but no folio or page
            number is expressed, or printed, on either display pages or blank pages.
